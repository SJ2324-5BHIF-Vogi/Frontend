## Features
* Infinite Scrolling through posts
* Navbar
* Responsive Design
* Neon Mode
* API Requests (Axios)
* Dynamic Routing

Note: The api requests don't work with real data from microservices yet. It only works with a mock api using the program Mockoon, selecting the .json files within the mock directory of the project and starting the server.
